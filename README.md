# Assembly Line Data Set Generator

This repository contains Python scripts to generate benchmark data instances for evaluating worker-task assignment and equipment allocation policies in multi-manned stochastic assembly lines. The data generation is based on a customized version of the benchmark generator proposed by [Otto et al. (2013)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2012.10.032), adapted to include process time uncertainty and compatibility constraints.
